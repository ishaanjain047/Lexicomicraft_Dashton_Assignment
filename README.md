The project I made is named Lexicomicraft which is made of Lexi + Comic + Craft

Lexi is a famous refrence of text as lexiography and rest we generate comic panels based on text hence it is called LexiComicCraft

Now what would be the common problems faced by the user ?

1. Not able to Edit the comic strips already generated
2. Deleting a comic panel already generated
3. Loosing their data after refreshing
4. Not able to see the status of their images which are in process of generation

My app has got them covererd, my app is not only response but provides them complete functionality of the above mentioned problems

Suppose we provide them with just 10 inputs, then the user doesnt have the flexiblity to use the app, but my app provides that by
giving delete button and adding new panels

The data is saved in local storage, so that the client do not have to follow the process again

I have also added small things such as activity loader and changed states of the button according to the status of API

Along with it, is a beautiful UI with modern dark theme which the client can use while travelling on the phone too

Error handling:

Clients are quiet confused when they encounter errors,

The app provides them alerts whenever they make a mistake, that is for example if they try generating comic which less than 10 images, they get an error based on the problem desription

Whenever the client clicks "My comic" button they get an error that they havent generated any comic

Note : The app is purely based on React and CSS,I have not included extra libraries like tailwind css, Bootscrap which could make
my work easy, just to show I am capable of making such assignement without libraries in a small time

Thanks for reading it out.
